# This project is no longer active!
I decided to no longer host the API. Feel free to host it yourself!\
The API was hosted using [fly.io](https://fly.io).\
The frontend was hosted using [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/).\
You can find the API source code [here](https://github.com/gillescoolen/taylor.rest).
